### **Hello Friend !**

My nickname is `1ntell0` pronounced as **/ɪnˈtɛl'əʊ/**. Also known as `retr0` by other people.
I am just another curious guy who happen to be enthusiastic about playing chess, learning new stuff, reading, using Arch Linux by the way, and everything related to computer systems. Such as programming, networking, securing and eventually hacking. With time I became less and less talkative about me and not sure what to add in this section, but you know my favorite topics now…my direct messages (DM) on my socials are open.

I made this blog as a preparation of my **OSCP** certification. I needed a place to share my writeups and notes related to cybersecurity/cyber security. 

I hope you find something interesting here. Happy hacking ! 😊
