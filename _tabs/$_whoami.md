### **Hello Friend !**

`1ntell0` pronounced as **/ɪnˈtɛl'əʊ/**. Also known recently as `retr0` from `return r0` or `retro` from the `WatchDogs` video game.
I am just another curious guy who happen to be enthusiastic about playing chess, using Linux with a KDE desktop, and everything related to computer systems. Such as programming, networking, securing and eventually hacking. With time I became less and less talkative about me and not sure what to add in this section, but you know my favorite topics now…my direct messages (DM) on my socials are open so hit me up and let’s talk if you got any questions.

I made this blog as a preparation of my **OSCP** certification. I needed a place to share my writeups and notes related to cybersecurity/cyber security. I hope you find something interesting here.

As of now I am got two professional certifications on my name, `PNPT(Practical Network Penetration Tester)` from TCM Security and `CPTS(Certified Penetration Tester Specialist)` from HTB(Hack The Box). More certs to come such as `CRTO(Certified Red Team Operator)` and `OSCP(Offensive Security Certified Professional)` are actively being worked on.
