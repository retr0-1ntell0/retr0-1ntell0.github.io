## Description

Like American Gangster, but for other stuff.

## Reversing
We downloaded the `gangster.zip` file and unzipped it.
We have access to this folder:
![note](Assets/Pictures/CTF/Nahamcon-2025/Notes-1.png)

Here is more about the content and type of file we are dealing with:

Turns out I went too far, so i came back to the zip file to read the metadata, and I noticed this long strings and luckily tried to decrypt it using `base64` and it gave us the flag. This was interesting and more of intuition engineering then reverse engineering ðŸ¤£

We solved the challenge and got the flag. This was fast and easy, but I was not expecting this to be so easy.
